# LocationInfoSender

"Locationinfosender" App is an attempt to put all the concepts which I had learned while working on Android Platform.
It fetches device current location when user click on "start" button once application launched. It would 
automatically send SMS(if enabled) to configured user after configured time duration. It would also 
put the updated current location on status bar which user can send to anyone using selected messenger
which is installed on the terminal. The "Setting" menu contains all the information about how to configure
this particular application.

All user are welcome to provide their valuable feedback/comment. Very Soon I am planning to upload this application on
Google Play Store so that it can be accessable to everyone.
